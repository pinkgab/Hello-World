  HTML is a markup language. HTML uses elements to tell a computer what to display on screen. It is the standard language for web pages.

  I wanted to take this class because given my previous experience with code, it seemed interesting and fun. My friends had told me about it and I was excited to further my knowledge of computers and web design. This class will help me gain skills in the field I want to enter once I join the work force.
